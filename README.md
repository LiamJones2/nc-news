# Creating environment variables
To make your own environment variables please make .env.development and .env.test files which will hold the name of the databases you make. Make sure those files are in .gitignore in order to not leak your database names. To create your databases run setup.sql, adjusting the names as you see fit, after creating the databases now you can do 'npm run seed' which will make the necessary tables and insert the data into them. 

If you have any problems please read the instructions above again and ensure the names to the databases are correct.
